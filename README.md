#  SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a complete **SQL Data Warehouse** built using **SQL Server**.  
The goal was to design and implement a modern data warehouse, starting from raw data files, applying the **Bronze–Silver–Gold** architecture, and creating a clean, structured environment ready for reporting and analysis.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Understand the full data warehousing process  
- Build an organized **data architecture**  
- Implement **ETL pipelines**  
- Design an efficient **data model** using **fact** and **dimension tables**  
- Prepare the data for further **analytics or BI dashboards**

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
The warehouse follows the **Bronze–Silver–Gold** structure:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data as extracted from the source (CSV files).  
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and transformed data, standardized and validated.  
- **Gold Layer:** Business-ready data modeled for reporting and analytical use.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Main database environment  
- **SQL** – For data manipulation, transformation, and modeling  
- **CSV files** – Used as raw data sources  

---

## 🔄 ETL Process
The project includes an end-to-end **ETL pipeline**:

1. **Extract** data from multiple CSV files.  
2. **Transform** the data (cleaning, formatting, deduplication, validation).  
3. **Load** the processed data into the warehouse, following the Bronze–Silver–Gold layers.  

---

## 🧮 Data Modeling
The **data model** is designed using:
- **Fact Tables** – Store quantitative data for analysis (e.g., sales, transactions).  
- **Dimension Tables** – Contain descriptive attributes (e.g., customers, products, dates).  

This structure supports efficient analytical queries and reporting.

---

## 📊 Results
By the end of the project, a fully functional **SQL Data Warehouse** was created.  
It provides a clear and organized data flow, ready for connection to BI tools for visualization and further analysis.
